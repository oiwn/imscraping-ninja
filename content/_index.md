Web scraping, also known as "web harvesting" or "web data extraction," is a
method used to extract valuable information from diverse sources in a structured
format, making it suitable for further utilization.

My typical projects encompass the development of web robots, data processing
systems, REST services, and SPA dashboards.

- Collecting data to train domain specific llms.
