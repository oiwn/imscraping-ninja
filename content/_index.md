Web scraping, also referred to as “web harvesting” or “web data extraction," is
a technique to extract valuable information from the various sources in
structured form suited for the further usage.

My typical projects involve the creation of web robots, data processing systems,
REST services and SPA dashboards.

I use the best available technologies to achieve quality results for my clients.
