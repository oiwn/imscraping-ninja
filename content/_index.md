Reinventing web data extraction, I turn raw, unstructured web content into
powerful, actionable intelligence. Leveraging Rust for high-speed, massive-scale
crawling alongside Python for flexible data processing, I create robust web robots
and distributed systems that deliver the data foundations for advanced machine
learning and AI projects.

My approach underpins everything from training domain-specific LLMs to building
next-gen AI solutions.

-	Training Domain-Specific LLMs: Data fuels the development of specialized language models tailored to unique industry needs.
-	Empowering AI Systems: Leverage data to power AI algorithms in areas like predictive analytics, computer vision, and natural language processing.
- Enhancing Decision-Making: Structured data drives business intelligence and real-time analytics for smarter decisions.
