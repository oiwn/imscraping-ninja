With over 10 years of experience in consulting and developing web scraping
projects, I have become a trusted expert in delivering time and cost-effective
solutions to my clients. My expertise in Python has enabled me to build
high-quality crawlers, but I am now leveraging the power of Rust to develop
efficient and scalable distributed web crawlers.

Hourly Rate: $70/h

I am excited to work on the following types of projects:

- Collaborative, semi-long term projects involving 1-3 team members who
  preferably have experience with Agile development methodologies.

- Large-scale website crawling - extracting data from millions of
  pages from different kind of websites.
  
- Collecting domain-specific data to train large language models,
  ensuring they excel in specialized areas. By efficiently curating and
  preprocessing high-quality datasets, I enable the creation of fine-tuned
  language models that provide valuable insights and enhance decision-making in
  various industries.

- By gathering diverse, high-quality data, I help train various machine learning
  and AI models, including image recognition, natural language processing,
  recommendation systems, and predictive analytics. My expertise in acquiring
  relevant data ensures that these AI systems are robust, accurate, and capable
  of addressing complex challenges across multiple industries.

- Price comparison system development, including regular crawling of multiple
  sources for data extraction, data transformation, and loading relevant
  information into databases.

- REST API development, enabling seamless integration and efficient
  communication between applications.
