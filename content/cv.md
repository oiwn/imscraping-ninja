I have more than 9 years of experience in both consulting and developing
projects for web scraping. I consistently help save my clients time and money.

Mostly with Python but currently developing web crawlers in Rust.

## Rate per hour from $40/h

I am interested in the following projects:

Semi-long term projects where 1-3 people are involved (who are ideally familiar
with agile development practices).

Large website crawling - Able to extract data from millions of pages from 
website like Amazon, Yelp, AngelList.

Price comparison systems development. This consists of the regular crawling of
few sources to extract data, transforming the data and finally loading the data
of interest into a database.

REST api development.
