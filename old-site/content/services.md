I have more than 6 years of experience in both consulting and developing
libraries for web scraping. I consistently help save my clients time and money.

## Rate per hour $40/h

I am interested in the following projects:

Semi-long term projects where 1-3 people are involved (who are ideally familiar
with agile development practices).


### Code review:

I can review your code and assist you with improvements.

### Web Scraping:

Large website crawling - I can scrape millions of pages from website like
Amazon, Yelp, AngelList.


### Development:

Price comparison systems development. This consists of the regular crawling of
few sources to extract data, transforming the data and finally loading the data
of interest into a database.

### REST API Development:

I can build an api on top of your data.

### Data processing and Machine Learning:

I can build data processing pipelines, complex data aggregation pipelines,
normalize data and load large volumes of unstructured data into the appropriate
storage solutions.

### Dashboard Creation:

I ca0n form a single page application to control the process of crawling and
processing data.
