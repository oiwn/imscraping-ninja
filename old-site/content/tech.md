I have a lot of experience with web scraping, data processing and creating web
dashboards. I've used those skills to create full data driven solutions such as
price monitoring systems, product databases, content aggregation, data pipelines
as well as the extraction of value from data using machine learning.

Here's a list of areas I have worked with in the past, and can provide
consulting on:


## Languages

- **Python**
- Javascript


## Web Scraping and Web Automation

- **Grab Framework** - an asynchronous web scraping framework (it uses pycurl
  and urllib3)
- Scrapy - same as above, but heavier and more general
- **Selenium** - for web automation, general testing and if a scraping project
  requires JS execution
- **PhantomJS** - a headless browser, used if there is a need to execute
  JavaScript

## Databases

- **MongoDB** - a schema-less database perfectly suited to use as a middle data warehouse
- **Redis** - in-memory database, used as a cache, tasks queue, pub/sub and for bloom filters
- **PostgreSQL** - RDBSM “traditional” database (tables, schema)
- **ElasticSearch** - search index
- **InfluxDB** - time series database (i.e. prices, quantities etc.)

## Backend

- Django - the most popular framework in the Python ecosystem
- Flask - a lightweight Python framework
- **aioHTTP** - an asynchronous client/server framework for Python > 3.5 based
  on the asyncio library
- Loopback - a javascript REST framework based on expressjs

## Frontend

- **ReactJS** - a front-end framework from Facebook
- AngularJS 1.x - a front-end framework from Google
- RiotJS - a tiny components framework (when React/Angular would be
  over-engeenering)
- Webpack - a build system for a front-end app
- ES6 - modern standard of javascript (ECMA2016)

## Testing

- Unit tests
- Property based tests
- Integrational tests
- BDD

## DevOps

- **Docker** - In most projects I use containers for services (API, Dashboard
  etc.) and for the deployment of applications
- Kubernetes - a cluster orchestration solution from Google (limited experience)
- Amazon AWS - I am proficient with Amazon's cloud solutions
- Heroku - PaaS cloud (limited experience)
- OpenShift - cloud computing solution from RedHat that recently moved to docker
  containers
